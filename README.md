which will be shown on the nbviewer website page and press Enter . for example i have link https://github.com/RavitejManduri/Project_Labelling_mulitple_cell_images_individually/blob/main/final-project-hpa-cell-label-prediction%20.ipynb
- Second Solution : Open google colab by using this link https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/gpu.ipynb in the browser. after that go the ‘File’ option at the ‘top-right’ . click on this and click again on open notebook .
